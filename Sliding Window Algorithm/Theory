array/string + subarray/substring +largest/maximum/minimum + window size(may be given / may be computed) == sliding window algorithm

TYPES :--
-------------
1. fix size  ---  condition to be maximized / minimized
2. variable size --- condition is given --> window needed to be minimized and maximized


Fixed size :-
--------------
1. max/min sum subarray of size k
2. 1st -ve in every size of k
3. count occurence of anagram
4. max of all subarray of size k
5. max of min for every window size

Dynamic size:-
---------------

1. largest/smallest subarray with sum k
2. largest substring with k unique characters
3. length of largest substring with no repeating characters
4. pick toys
5. minimum window substring
